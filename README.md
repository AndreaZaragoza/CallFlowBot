# CallFlowBot
A minimal AI call agent demo built with Flask. It simulates the behavior of a voice assistant that responds with helpful, human-like answers; designed to reflect real-world AI integrations like those used in customer service automation. Built as a sample project to demonstrate my interest in AI deployment, API integrations, and user-centric design.
